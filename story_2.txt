Long ago, in a kingdom far away, there was a humble blacksmith named Alden. He was known throughout the land for crafting the finest swords, 
but he longed for adventure beyond his forge. One evening, a mysterious traveler appeared in his shop, carrying a broken sword made of an unfamiliar metal. 
The traveler told Alden that this was no ordinary swordâ€”it was a key to unlocking the gates of a forgotten city hidden in the clouds.
With a sense of destiny, Alden agreed to repair the sword, knowing it would lead him to a journey unlike any other.
